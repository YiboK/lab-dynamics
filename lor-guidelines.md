# Guidelines to request letter of recommendation

In order for me yo write you a letter of recommendation for graduate school, please read this document carefully and follow the steps.

## 1. Make sure to start with plenty of time
I will need to know the programs you will be applying to, as well as relevant information about your application at least three weeks before the first deadline. It is a good idea to start working on your application with time. You usually want to have a full draft of the application and list of programs by early October.

## 2. To request LOR, first collect the following information
- For every program:
    - University
    - Name of the program
    - Deadline
    - Program link
    - Physical address of the department/school
- CV
- Personal statement (it does not need to be the final polished version, but a good complete draft)

## 3. Fill out a google form per program
Three weeks before the first deadline (or November 15 whatever happens first), you need to 
- fill out [the google form](https://forms.gle/ozvDqMxaPhvXdh399) for each of the programs in your list. That is, if you need letter of recommendation for 15 programs, you need to fill out the google form 15 times with the information of each program. Since I work on the letters in bulk, I need to know of all programs roughly at the same time. For example, if you are applying to 15 programs and the first deadline is November 15, you need to fill out the google form with all 15 programs by October 25. LORs to programs not in the original list can be approved under extenuating circumstances.
- send me by email or slack your CV and draft of personal statement

Note that here is no limit to the number of letters that you can ask me as long as you follow the rules described and I am also happy to give you feedback on your application if you want.
