# Onboarding steps

1. Read the [lab guidelines](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/lab-guidelines.md)
2. Read the [computing and reproducibility practices](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md) and links therein
3. Add yourself to the [lab website](https://solislemuslab.github.io//pages/people.html) via a pull request. Not sure how to do this? Perfect time to study more about git and github. Some resources [here](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md)

## For graduate students and postdocs
5. Start thinking about your [project plan](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/project-plan.md)


# Offboarding steps

We are sad to see you go, but excited for the new posibilities in your future!

Steps before you leave the lab:

1. Make sure to document all your work and leave an updated version of any incomplete project in github. If you have files in the cluster, make sure to clean them up and back up anything that you need to take with you
2. Remove yourself from the [lab website](https://solislemuslab.github.io//pages/people.html) (repo [here](https://github.com/solislemuslab/solislemuslab.github.io)) and add yourself to the "Past members" section. Please include where you will be (if you already know). You will do this via a pull request. You should be familiar with github by now, but if you are not sure how to do this, check some github resources [here](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md)
3. Email Pat Pointer from WID to let her know that you will leave my lab so that she update your WID account (either remove it or change it to other lab). Please copy me in this email
4. Fill out the offboarding form with your new contact information [here](https://forms.gle/Utj4pTHwMe456zyMA). This is so that I can reach out regarding our projects together (publications, extensions to our work, presentations,...)
