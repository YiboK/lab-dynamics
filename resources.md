There are many skills that we need to informally learn in academia: written and oral communication skills; reproducibility; lab dynamics like working on a team, giving/accepting constructive feedback; getting your own funding... Here I've compiled a list of resources (hopefully up to date) to learn more about some of those skills.

# Reproducibility and best computing practices

- Motivating reading on the importance of reproducibility: [Nature collection](https://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552)
- The importance of Open Science in Andrew Gelman's [blog](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/06/11/bla-bla-bla-peer-review-bla-bla-bla/)
- My notes on [mindful programming](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md)
- [Tools for Reproducible Research](http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/) by Karl Broman


# Peer-reviews and publishing

- [JEFworks guide to peer review](https://jef.works/blog/2020/03/23/a-guide-to-scientific-peer-review/)
- [Connected papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) is a visualization tool to see how papers in a certain field are connected. This is helpful when finding papers or experts related to a topic
- Some thoughts on [authorship guidelines](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Policies/blob/master/Authorship_Guidelines.md) from the [Beckman Research Group](http://seedscape.github.io/BeckmanLab/)


# Getting funding

Showing that you are able to acquire your own funding is very important in the academic landscape. Even if you are fully funded by your department or PI, consider applying to a scholarship or fellowship to learn valuable grant writing skills and improving your CV.
A few examples below.

- NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [GRFP](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201)

- NIH K99/R00 Path to Independence [award](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/career-development/k99-r00) (for postdocs)

- Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Awards at the Scientific Interface [CASI](https://www.bwfund.org/grant-programs/interfaces-science/career-awards-scientific-interface) (for postdocs)
