# Are you interested in joining the Solis-Lemus lab?

- If you are an undergraduate student:
    - currently enrolled at UW-Madison looking for research experience, read [this section](#undergrad)

## Are you an undergraduate student currently enrolled at UW-Madison looking for research experience? <a name="undergrad"></a>

I receive many applications for research positions in my lab and can only accept students who are serious about the effort involved and where there is a good fit with my group. 

First of all, please read the rules regarding undergraduate research in the lab:
- All research led by undergraduate students is expected to produce either a publication or software. For this reason, only highly motivated students looking for long-term research opportunities (at least one year in the lab) are welcome.
    - Short-term projects are sometimes available in the lab. If you are interested in one-semester or one-summer work, feel free to email me to let me know about this interest, but there is no guarantee that there will be a project that will accomodate to this timeline.
- Seniors are not admitted to join the lab as there is not enough time to do meaningful research. The best time to join the lab is the beginning of junior year or the summer immediately before junior year.
- Knowledge of version control via git/github is a must as well as interest on good computing practices, team work and science communication.
- There will be a trial period in which you will be assigned to an existing project. This trial period will give you the opportunity to learn if the lab is a good fit for you.
- Team work is highly valued in the lab, so you are expected to fully participate in meetings, symposia and other events

Advantages of joining the lab:
- Participate in state-of-the-art research as the leader of a project
- Gain research experience that is valuable for graduate school and data science industry jobs (computing practices, reproducibility, science communication, research independence)
- Plenty of opportunities to improve science communication (talks, posters, papers)
- Co-authorship on publications produced in the lab with your contribution (read the [authorship guidelines](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/authorship.md))
- Network with other students in the lab and in WID
- Strong commitment to mentoring by me and other senior students in the lab
- Support with grad school/job applications as well as carefully written honest letters of recommendation highlighting your strengths in research

### Am I a good fit for the lab?

1. Take the [git quiz](https://learn.co/lessons/git-github-learn-quiz)
    - If you scored 8 or higher, you are in great shape!
    - If you scored less than 8, you need to study git/github. Study [these notes](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md) carefully 

2. Read the [best computing practices](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md#1-best-computing-practices) of the lab and answer the following questions:
    - Am I interested in producing code that is well-documented and commented?
    - Am I interested in spending a lot of time making sure my code is understandable to others and it follows good computing practices?
    - Am I interested in following the structure for file names and folders?
    - Am I interested in learning git/github using the terminal?

3. Read the [lab guidelines](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/lab-guidelines.md) and answer the following questions:
    - Am I interested in participating in lab meetings, WID meetings and student events?
    - Am I interested in presenting my research in symposia via talks or posters?
    - Am I committed to see the project through either by finishing up all steps during my time in the lab or by helping other students take over the project?

### Expected timeline when you join the lab

Timeline varies depending on the nature of the project, but this example can serve to illustrate the different stages:
- Summer before junior year (2-3 months): learn about the project and necessary background knowledge, learn good computing practices and git/github through the terminal, trial period on existing project
- Fall/Spring junior year (2 semesters): work on your project as independent research or as part of a team of students
- Summer before senior year: usually students do internships, so no work in the lab, but students could be involved in short-term projects if they choose to or continue working on their projects
- Fall senior year (1 semester): write paper for publication or deploy software. Deadline of December 1 so that the new product (paper/software) can be included in grad school or job application

### After reading this document, I am still interested in joining the lab!

Great! Follow the next steps:

1. Fill out [this google form](https://forms.gle/8B8c1hcMUr5tXZeW7) which is the collaboration agreement
2. Email me your CV and transcript with the subject "Data Science Undergrad Research". Write down in the email that you have read this document and filled out the collaboration agreement form. Include in the email meeting times that would work for you for the following two weeks.

After you send the email, we will schedule a meeting to chat. Expect to answer questions about yourself (major, year, research interests) as well as about programming skills and knowledge of git and computing practices. It will not be an exam, but I will be curious to know your experience. During this meeting, I will also highlight existing projects in the lab to assess if they would be interesting to you.


After our meeting, we will both decide if you are a good fit for the lab and the lab is a good fit for you. The final steps to join the lab are:
1. Complete the [onboarding steps](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/on-off-boarding.md)
2. Choose a current project in the lab (current papers/software), read all about it and think of ways in which the work can be extended. This is to determine your project for the trial period.
3. Complete the github learning assessment
4. Discuss practical issues:
    - Do you need to get paid for your research? Or would getting course credit be enough?
    - How many hours a week do you want to work on a research project with me?
    - When do you want to start?
