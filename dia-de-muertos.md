# Dia de Muertos

The "Dia de Muertos" ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead)) is a Mexican holiday celebrated on November 2nd of every year. Mexicans put up an "altar" or "ofrenda" to pay tribute to family members and friends who have died. It is believed that on the night of November 2nd, the souls of the dead come back to the Earth to eat and drink what we leave in the altar.

The altar can include food and drinks that the beloved dead enjoyed in life, as well as other items (cigarettes, cards, books) that they loved. The altar should also have [cempazuchilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagetes_erecta) flowers. It is believed that the scent of these flowers guides the souls to the altar.

## How to participate?

You can bring a photo of a person you want to remember and an item that they loved (if it is food, non-perishable please!). The WID altar will stay in place until November 3rd.
