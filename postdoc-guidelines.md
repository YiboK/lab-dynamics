# Postdoc guidelines in the Solis-Lemus lab

### What to expect when you join the lab:
- We will have a conversation early on about your future career plans to devise a strategy together
- Claudia will be fully committed to your growth and success as a scientist and to help you reach your career goals
- We will have a clear conversation about projects that belong to the lab and independent projects that will belong to you after you leave
- Claudia will provide you with constant opportunities to grow on important academic skills:
    - academic writing
    - science communication skills
    - peer reviewing for journals
    - good computing practices
    - mentoring skills
    - conference presentations
    - grant writing skills
- Claudia will fully support your quest to find your own fellowships or funding
- Aside from your academic success, your emotional, physical and spiritual well-being will always be a priority in the lab


### What is expected of you:
- You will read and follow the lab guidelines: see [here](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/lab-guidelines.md)
- You will follow the best computing practices (highlighted [here](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md)) on
    - folder organization
    - file names
    - version control with git/Github
    - reproducibility
    - clear and well-commented code
- You will write the project plan (see format [here](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/project-plan.md)) for the project that we agree to work on together (described in a separate document) within ___ weeks of your arrival to the lab
    - The project plan should be the first item to agree on as it will guide the whole project
    - We can discuss and revise this document together prior to the final version we will agree on
- You will have the intellectual freedom to propose how the project(s) should be tackled and your strategy will be reflected in the project plan that we will both agree on
- You will be the leading force of the project(s) that we agree to work on together (described in a separate document)
    - You are expected to be first author in the paper(s) and Claudia will be last/corresponding author (see authorship guidelines)
    - You will have the opportunity to mentor graduate or undergraduate students to work with you on this project
- Aside from the main project(s) that we agreed to work on together (described in a separate document), you are welcome to work on other side projects as long as you distribute time: 80% on the lab projects and 20% on the side projects
    - All side projects should be discussed with Claudia so that she knows the different projects you are working on at a given time (e.g. to avoid adding extra tasks on your plate)

### Other rules:
- The Solis-Lemus lab deeply values good science communication: writing, quality of figures and paper presentation needs to be approved by Claudia to make sure that they satisfy the requirements of good science communication
- The Solis-Lemus lab deeply values open-source software so methodological papers should be accompanied by open-source software hosted on Github and whenever possible, published as software that others can use
- All abstracts, posters, talks, preprints and papers that you work on in the lab are representations of the lab and must be approved by Claudia before submission
