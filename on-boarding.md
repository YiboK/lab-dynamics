# Onboarding steps

1. Read the [lab guidelines](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/lab-guidelines.md)
2. Read the [computing and reproducibility practices](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md) and links therein
3. Add yourself to the [lab website](https://solislemuslab.github.io//pages/people.html) via a pull request. Not sure how to do this? Perfect time to study more about git and github. Some resources [here](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md)

## For graduate students and postdocs
4. Start thinking about your [project plan](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/project-plan.md)
